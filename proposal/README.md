# Outlier Detection in Temporal Network Data

## Introduction

Organizations typically monitor internal network traffic for threats, many of
which can automatically detected and often even mitigated with the help of
tools and network appliances like firewalls and intrusion prevention systems
(IPS). Often these organizations will also have analysts dedicated to
determining if further investigation and mitigation should take place for
detected threats. Analyst may also look for threats not automatically detected,
incorrectly detected or only detected in part. Because of the volume of traffic
on the network, analysts can only consider a small fraction of the traffic in
any detail. Automatically detected threats can often be assigned a severity to
prioritize what analysts should look at first. For novel threats, however,
thereâ€™s a greater burden on analysts to find suspect traffic. Visually encoding
network traffic might give analysts the ability to detect certain anomalous
patterns and help guide further analysis. 

TODO:

  - Brief abstract (3-4 sentences) giving a summary of your proposal
  - Research questions you will be addressing
  - List of your preliminary hypotheses
  - Hardware and software you will use to complete your implementation (displays, input devices, toolkits, languages, etc.)
  - Tasks and metrics you might use to test your hypotheses
